# PWM_generator
This program generates PWM to drive the motors using TI MSP432. The program has functions that takes duty cycle and time as input to determine the speed and time period to drive the motor. 
This PWM generator can be used with interrupt to drive the motor only when the sensor that are connected are reading a certain input.

There are separate function to drive the motor in forward , backward or drive only left or right motor individually.
